# Particle Emitter
Simple particle emitter made in C++ and Allegro (simple 2D graphic library)

The library just let you draw primitives (or pixels) directly to the videocard memory. In this case, every particle is a pixel (with, x, y and RGB values).

Remember that the library is just for drawing; it's not a game engine.. the pointer, double buffer, particle system, collision detection, physics, and timer, were all made from scratch.

This was a testing ground to perfect the particles system, that were later used in my other game <a href="https://github.com/Ni7ram/Insane2">Insane 2</a>.
